# CBH Module3 Practical 4 Data Visualization
**Date: Oct 2, 2025**

**Time: 9AM-11AM ET**

**Instructor: Han Yu**

## Description

This workshop will introduce participants to creating flexible, aesthetic and informative visualizations in R for statistical computing through the Grammar of Graphics framework. The seminar explores the fundamental concepts and structure of ggplot2 commands and will guide you in selecting the most effective visualizations for your data. Moving to advanced customization, participants will learn techniques for transforming data with scales, using faceting for complex comparisons, and enhancing visual aesthetics through themes and formatting options.

The seminar will also dive into specialized plots (e.g., heatmaps, Kaplan-Meier curves) and explore interactive features using the plotly package and showcase extending the former through the Shiny web application framework. The workshop will emphasize the importance of working with and understanding your data, to allow for tailoring visualizations to extract the most out of your data for your audience, equipping participants with a versatile toolkit for effective data storytelling.
